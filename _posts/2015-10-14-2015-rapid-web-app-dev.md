excerpt: "Java web application development doesn't have to be frustrating and wrought with boilerplate. Your client-side code can and _should_ be modern, elegant, and efficient. You can get a modern project with a REST API up and running FAST with Spring Boot, Java 8, React, and webpack. And communication with the server is a breeze using cutting edge web APIs such as fetch()."
