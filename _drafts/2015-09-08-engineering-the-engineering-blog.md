I'm working on expanding the following outline into a full-fledged post. If anyone has any thoughts or insight, feel free to markup this draft with comments.

* the inception
	* noting that we do cool things at widen, but they are often not visible outside the company
	* desire to produce more open-source software and give back to the community
	* leveraging other companies blogs and open-source software portals
* fleshing out our needs
* finding a solution (link to static site generator throwdown post)
* carving out time to actually work
	* how you convince your manager, peers, etc. that developer relations is important
	* making time for something that doesn't directly produce revenue
	* branding and working with marketing (to have a cohesive brand experience)
	* internal adoption (we still have to do this...)
* the finalized stack (gritty technical details and deploy process) [is this needed? should this be its own post?]
* conclusion: learning to just press publish (and not letting process prevent progress)
	* realistic, detailed goals
	* clearly defined mvp
