I'm working on expanding the following outline into a full-fledged post. If anyone has any thoughts or insight, feel free to markup this draft with comments.

* the idea
* fleshing out our needs
* vetting the options (show code samples, pros, cons)
	* middleman
	* jekyll
	* pelican
	* blacksmith
* figuring out what works best for *us* (hint: the thing that has the least resistance)
* carving out time to actually work
	* adoption
	* branding and working with marketing
	* mvp
* the finalized stack (gritty technical details and deploy process)
* learning to just press publish (and not letting process prevent progress)
